Data analysis on Apple's Revenues

For this data analysis exercise we are going to try and predict Appleâ€™s (AAPL) revenue for the fiscal year 2018.
In order to do that, we first had to decide which source, i.e. data, we are going to use.
After some research we found a really interesting dataset which contains Apple's revenue per Quarter from 2006 to 2017, expressed in Billions of Dollars ($).
